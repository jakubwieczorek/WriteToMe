# WriteToMe!

## About
WriteToMe! is a server-client standalone chat application with functionality like sending messages between friends, inviting or deleting them it also shows in real time when the friend logged in or out with a few seconds delay. It was my first project written in java on second year of my studies for event programming subject. The front-end layer - user interface was written in swing library and the logic part of the application especially the network side with the help of low-level server socket structures, so complitely from scratch without any high level network libraries support. Project was written following the MVC pattern.

**To find out more, please check out the [WriteToMe!][wiki].**

## Project structure
The application consists of two parts: the client and server side. Also in seperate directory are executable jars, which you can simply use and the code documentation.
